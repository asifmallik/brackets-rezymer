#Brackets Rezymer
Brackets Rezymer is an extension for Brackets which allows searching and modifying HTML DOM by utilizing CSS Selectors and jQuery API directly from Brackets! It uses Cheerio library from node to parse and query the HTML.

##Installation
Installation can be done in two ways:

1) Installing from extension manager by going to `File` > `Extension Manager` then search for `Brackets Rezymer`

2) Installing directly from GitHub. This way you can get the latest version of Brackets-ES6.
`File` > `Extension Manager` > `Install from URL` > `http://github.com/asifmallik/brackets-rezymer` > `Install`

##Future
I am currently working on the atom editor version of this extension with CoffeeScript and of course improving Brackets Rezymer. Check TODO.md for more.

Enjoy!
