Brackets Rezymer is an extension for Brackets which allows searching and modifying HTML DOM by utilizing CSS Selectors and jQuery API directly from Brackets! It uses Cheerio library to parse and query the HTML.

##Installation
Installation can be done in two ways:

1) Installing from extension manager by going to `File` > `Extension Manager` then search for `Brackets Rezymer`

2) Installing directly from GitHub. This way you can get the latest version of Brackets-ES6.
`File` > `Extension Manager` > `Install from URL` > `http://github.com/asifmallik/brackets-rezymer` > `Install`

##Usage
![Brackets Rezymer Demo](http://i.imgur.com/qflYBrj.gif)
After installation hit `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `R` or go to `Rezymer` > `Query HTML` from the menu to bring out the Rezymer bar. Then type in your CSS selector into the query input to search through the HTML file for the desired tags. Check modify in order to run jQuery methods on the selected elements.

##Future
I am currently working on the atom editor version of this extension with CoffeeScript and of course improving Brackets Rezymer. Check TODO.md for more.

Enjoy!
